>>-Description:-

This project is a Smart Irrigation System that uses a Soil Moisture Sensor and a Humidity Sensor (DHT22/DHT11) to monitor environmental conditions.
It integrates Machine Learning (ML) to predict irrigation needs and provides a dashboard to visualize real-time and historical data.

The system helps optimize water usage in agriculture by:

1.Monitoring soil moisture and humidity in real-time.

2.Automatically controlling a water pump using threshold values & ML predictions.

3.Displaying sensor data and irrigation status on a dashboard.

4.Using ML models to forecast soil moisture trends for better decision-making.
